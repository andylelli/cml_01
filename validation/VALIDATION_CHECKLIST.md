# CML 2.0 Validation Checklist

## A. Structural Integrity
- [ ] All required top-level sections present
- [ ] Exactly one `false_assumption.type`
- [ ] No empty required fields
- [ ] All entities referenced exist elsewhere in the case

## B. Axis Dominance
- [ ] Only one primary deception axis drives resolution
- [ ] Other axes appear only as secondary effects
- [ ] Removing secondary effects does not break solution

## C. Epistemic Integrity
- [ ] Surface model contains no lies, only misinterpretations
- [ ] Hidden model introduces no new facts
- [ ] Hidden model uses only constraint-space-permitted actions

## D. False Assumption Test (Hard Gate)
- [ ] Removing the false assumption collapses surface conclusions
- [ ] Keeping all facts but correcting belief resolves case
- [ ] No alternative assumption also explains the case

## E. Inference Path Validity
- [ ] Each step reduces uncertainty
- [ ] No step relies on confession or coercion
- [ ] No step introduces new evidence
- [ ] Steps are order-dependent and monotonic

## F. Discriminating Test Soundness
- [ ] Test distinguishes culprit from all innocents
- [ ] Test forces revelation of privileged knowledge
- [ ] Test outcome is binary and falsifiable

## G. Fair-Play Guarantees
- [ ] All clues available before solution
- [ ] No expert or esoteric knowledge required
- [ ] Reader could logically solve case
- [ ] Explanation explicitly defends solvability
