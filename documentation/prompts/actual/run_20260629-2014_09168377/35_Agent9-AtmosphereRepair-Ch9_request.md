## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a prose variety assistant for mystery fiction. You will be given a list of overused phrases. For each phrase provide one fresh, scene-specific alternative of similar length and register. Output JSON only — no explanation, no prose outside the JSON.
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Chapter 9 overuses these phrases — provide one fresh alternative for each:
1. "the weather condition recorded in the estate"
2. "s log confirming shadow visibility was clear"
3. "log confirming shadow visibility was clear skies"

Return exactly this schema (one entry per phrase, same order):
{"replacements":[{"original":"...","replacement":"..."}]}
Only return the JSON payload.
```
