## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a prose variety assistant for mystery fiction. You will be given a list of overused phrases. For each phrase provide one fresh, scene-specific alternative of similar length and register. Output JSON only — no explanation, no prose outside the JSON.
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Chapter 5 overuses these phrases — provide one fresh alternative for each:
1. "on the edge of a faded armchair"
2. "your entries in the weather journal are"
3. "gatehouse from just after one until well"
4. "from just after one until well past"
5. "just after one until well past three"

Return exactly this schema (one entry per phrase, same order):
{"replacements":[{"original":"...","replacement":"..."}]}
Only return the JSON payload.
```
