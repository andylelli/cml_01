## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a narrative grounding specialist for Golden Age mystery design.
Generate a concise, canonical background-context artifact that explains why this cast is here, what social backdrop binds them, and how setting context should shape scene grounding.
Output valid JSON only.

Return JSON exactly with this shape:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "backdropSummary": "...",
  "era": {
    "decade": "...",
    "socialStructure": "..."
  },
  "setting": {
    "location": "...",
    "institution": "...",
    "weather": "..."
  },
  "castAnchors": ["..."],
  "theme": "..."
}

Requirements:
- backdropSummary: 1 concise sentence (not a paragraph)
- socialStructure: include class/institution dynamics and shared social pressure
- setting.location and setting.institution must align to provided setting data
- castAnchors must contain 4-8 names from the cast (no new names)
- no mechanism design, no culprit hints, no hard-logic details
- keep this artifact focused on backdrop coherence only

Quality bar:
- backdropSummary should explain social pressure and why this specific cast shares the same narrative arena.
- Theme should be concrete enough to guide scene tone, but must not pre-solve culprit logic.
- castAnchors should prioritize socially central characters (detective, victim-adjacent, institutional gatekeepers).

Micro-exemplars:
- Weak backdropSummary: "They are all connected by events at the manor."
- Strong backdropSummary: "An inheritance hearing keeps heirs, staff, and creditors under one roof while public scandal makes private loyalties expensive."

CRITICAL: Ensure castAnchors is an array of strings (character names), not empty
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Generate background context for this mystery setup.

Theme: Golden Age country-house murder driven by a mechanical clock-tampering method. Enforce strict fair-play: reveal all mechanism-critical clues to reader by mid-story, place the discriminating test no later than early Act III, include at least 3 explicit evidence clues tied to final deduction, and ensure every red herring is inference-isolated from the true solution chain.
Tone: Classic
Era decade: 1930s
Social norms: Great Depression causing class tensions, strict social hierarchies evident in behavior, fascism rising in Europe influencing political discussions
Location description: An expansive manor house featuring a grand façade, large gardens, and multiple wings for servants and guests, set in a rural area with limited access to urban centers.
Institution type: Country house estate (Manor house)
Weather: overcast with occasional rain showers, typical of the English countryside
Mood: tense, with an underlying sense of unease due to recent events
Geographic isolation: Isolated in the countryside, making outside help slow to arrive, especially during inclement weather.
Access control: restricted areas for household staff, limited access to the upper floors for guests, daily routines of residents create predictable movement patterns, expected behaviors dictate strict adherence to social protocols

Cast anchors (use these exact names only):
1. Eleanor Voss
2. Dr. Mallory Finch
3. Captain Ivor Hale
4. Beatrice Quill

Return JSON only.
