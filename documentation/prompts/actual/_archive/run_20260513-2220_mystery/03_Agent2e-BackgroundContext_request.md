## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a narrative grounding specialist for Golden Age mystery design.
Generate a concise, canonical background-context artifact that explains why this cast is here, what social backdrop binds them, and how setting context should shape scene grounding.
Output valid JSON only.

Return JSON exactly with this shape:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "backdropSummary": "...",
  "era": {
    "decade": "...",
    "socialStructure": "..."
  },
  "setting": {
    "location": "...",
    "institution": "...",
    "weather": "..."
  },
  "castAnchors": ["..."],
  "theme": "..."
}

Requirements:
- backdropSummary: 1 concise sentence (not a paragraph)
- socialStructure: include class/institution dynamics and shared social pressure
- setting.location and setting.institution must align to provided setting data
- castAnchors must contain 4-8 names from the cast (no new names)
- no mechanism design, no culprit hints, no hard-logic details
- keep this artifact focused on backdrop coherence only

Quality bar:
- backdropSummary should explain social pressure and why this specific cast shares the same narrative arena.
- Theme should be concrete enough to guide scene tone, but must not pre-solve culprit logic.
- castAnchors should prioritize socially central characters (detective, victim-adjacent, institutional gatekeepers).

Micro-exemplars:
- Weak backdropSummary: "They are all connected by events at the manor."
- Strong backdropSummary: "An inheritance hearing keeps heirs, staff, and creditors under one roof while public scandal makes private loyalties expensive."

CRITICAL: Ensure castAnchors is an array of strings (character names), not empty
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Generate background context for this mystery setup.

Theme: Golden Age country-house murder driven by a mechanical clock-tampering method. Enforce strict fair-play: reveal all mechanism-critical clues to reader by mid-story, place the discriminating test no later than early Act III, include at least 3 explicit evidence clues tied to final deduction, and ensure every red herring is inference-isolated from the true solution chain.
Tone: Classic
Era decade: 1930s
Social norms: impact of the Great Depression affecting social gatherings, class distinctions prominent in estate management, growing political tensions with fascism in Europe
Location description: A sprawling country estate with a large main house, formal gardens, and several outbuildings, reflecting the wealth of its owners.
Institution type: Manor house
Weather: Overcast with intermittent rain, typical of the English countryside in the fall.
Mood: Tense, reflecting underlying class struggles and political unease.
Geographic isolation: The estate is situated several miles from the nearest town, limiting immediate outside assistance.
Access control: restricted areas such as the library and cellar, daily schedules dictating movements of staff and guests, social hierarchies influencing access to certain areas

Cast anchors (use these exact names only):
1. Eleanor Voss
2. Dr. Mallory Finch
3. Captain Ivor Hale
4. Beatrice Quill

Return JSON only.
