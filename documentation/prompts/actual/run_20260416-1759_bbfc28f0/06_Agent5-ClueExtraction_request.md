## CML Summary
**Title**: The Timely Deceit
**Crime**: murder
**Primary axis**: temporal axis
**Cast**: 5 characters
**Requested density**: minimal
**Effective density**: moderate (auto-escalated to satisfy mandatory requirements)

## Mandatory Clue Requirements (10 required)
1. Generate a clue that makes the reader directly observe: "The clock in the study shows the time as ten o'clock, but it has minor scratches on the minute hand...."
   → observation | essential | early | temporal | step 1 | terms: clock, study, shows

2. Generate a clue that provides evidence for: "The scratches suggest recent tampering of the clock mechanism...."
   → contradiction | essential | early | temporal | step 1 | terms: scratches, suggest, recent

3. Generate a clue that makes the reader directly observe: "Witnesses recall that the clock chimed incorrectly just before the murder...."
   → observation | essential | early | temporal | step 2 | terms: witnesses, recall, clock

4. Generate a clue that provides evidence for: "The incorrect chiming indicates the clock may have been altered to mislead the time of death...."
   → contradiction | essential | early | temporal | step 2 | terms: incorrect, chiming, indicates

5. Generate a clue that makes the reader directly observe: "A faint smell of oil is detected near the clock's mechanism...."
   → observation | essential | mid | temporal | step 3 | terms: faint, smell, detected

6. Generate a clue that provides evidence for: "The oil indicates recent maintenance or tampering, likely by someone trying to alter its function...."
   → contradiction | essential | mid | testimonial | step 3 | terms: indicates, recent, maintenance

7. Generate a clue that provides observable evidence the reader must see BEFORE the discriminating test can be understood. The test exploits this evidence — it does NOT reveal it. Evidence for: "Katherine Dalton arranges a confrontation where Gerald must explain the clock's condition and the ti..."
   → observation | essential | mid | temporal | terms: katherine, dalton, arranges

8. Generate a clue showing observable evidence of Gerald Chalcott's premeditation or planning (financial desperation). This MUST be visible to the reader before the confrontation scene — the detective cannot privately know this and withhold it.
   → observation | essential | mid | behavioral | terms: financial, desperation

9. Generate a clue that provides elimination evidence for suspect: Geoffrey Pilgrim
   → elimination | essential | mid | testimonial | terms: Geoffrey Pilgrim

10. Generate a clue that provides elimination evidence for suspect: Carol Stratton
   → elimination | essential | mid | testimonial | terms: Carol Stratton

## Temporal Constraints
- The clock shows ten o'clock.
- Witnesses remember the clock chiming at ten, but evidence shows it was altered.

## Access Constraints
Actors: Gerald Chalcott, Ralph Clifton
Objects: the clock, kitchen knife

## Physical Evidence
- Fingerprints found on the clock's casing.

## Evidence-Sensitive Characters
- Ralph Clifton: sensitive items: high
- Gerald Chalcott: sensitive items: medium
- Geoffrey Pilgrim: sensitive items: high
- Katherine Dalton: sensitive items: low
- Carol Stratton: sensitive items: high

## Hard Precedence (resolve in order)
1. sourceInCML legality
2. index bounds and cast name-index correctness
3. discriminating-test clue ID coverage
4. suspect elimination quality
5. red-herring separation
6. optional texture

## Generation Order (Critical)
1. Build clues[].id and clues[].sourceInCML first.
2. Validate source paths against valid_source_paths[] when available; otherwise allowed roots + bounds.
3. Populate clue description/pointsTo text.
4. Build elimination details.
5. Generate red herrings last.
6. Set status based on unresolved hard-rule defects.

## Deterministic Bounds (use exactly)
- inference_path steps path index range: 0..2
- supportsInferenceStep valid range: 1..3
- constraint_space.time.anchors index range: 0..0
- constraint_space.time.contradictions index range: 0..0
- cast index range: 0..4

## Cast Name -> Index Map (for CASE.cast[N] paths)
- Ralph Clifton -> 0
- Gerald Chalcott -> 1
- Geoffrey Pilgrim -> 2
- Katherine Dalton -> 3
- Carol Stratton -> 4

## Clue Density: moderate
Generate 8-12 clues total.
Additional optional clues (2-4 extra) for texture.

## Red Herring Budget: 2
Create 2 red herrings that support the false assumption: "Ralph Clifton was murdered shortly after the clock chimed ten o'clock."

## Red Herring Lexical Guardrails (proactive first-attempt)
- correction_terms_forbidden_in_red_herrings:
  - scratches
  - suggest
  - recent
  - incorrect
  - chiming
  - indicates
  - maintenance
- preferred_false_assumption_terms:
  - ralph
  - clifton
  - murdered
- red_herring_contract:
  - Use preferred_false_assumption_terms where possible.
  - Avoid correction_terms_forbidden_in_red_herrings in redHerrings[].description and redHerrings[].misdirection.
  - Include one sentence in each misdirection explicitly justifying non-overlap with true-solution mechanism language.

## Clue Placement Strategy
- Early (Act I): essential clues, set up the puzzle, introduce key observations
- Mid (Act II): supporting clues, deepen investigation, complicate the picture
- Late (Act III): optional clues, final revelations, confirm the solution

Criticality levels:
- essential: reader must see this to follow the detective's logic
- supporting: reinforces key deductions without being critical
- optional: adds texture and atmosphere

## Quality Controls (from CML)
- Essential clues minimum: 3
- Essential clues before test: true
- Early clues minimum: 2
- Mid clues minimum: 2
- Late clues minimum: 1

If targets conflict with clue density, prioritize fair play (essential clues and early placement).
If mandatory requirements exceed requested density, satisfy mandatory requirements first and keep optional clues minimal.

## Quality Bar
- Essential clues must form a solvable chain, not disconnected facts.
- Clue wording should be concrete enough for scene-level prose rendering.
- Placement should enforce fair-play timing rather than clustering clues at reveal.

## Hard Constraints Learned from Failures
- Discriminating-test clue ID coverage is mandatory: every ID in CASE.discriminating_test.evidence_clues must appear as a clue id.
- Required discriminating-test clue IDs must be criticality: essential and placement: early|mid.
- Elimination clues must include a concrete alibi window, corroborator/evidence source, and explicit exclusion logic in pointsTo.
- sourceInCML must use legal CML paths only; do not invent path families.
- Red herrings must support the false assumption and include non-overlap justification vs true culprit mechanism facts.
- Narrative-facing time wording must be era-appropriate and written in words (for example, "quarter past nine", not "9:15 PM").
- supportsInferenceStep and step-indexed sourceInCML references must stay within actual inference-path bounds.
- Red herring text must not reuse correction-language tokens from inference_path.steps[].correction.
- If inference_path has 3 step(s), valid supportsInferenceStep/source step indices are 1..3 and 0..2 respectively.
- Cast paths must use CASE.cast[N] with N from the Name->Index map above. Do not substitute names inside brackets.

## Failure-Mode Hardening (pass-first)
- If valid_source_paths[] is provided, sourceInCML should exactly match one listed path.
- If sourceInCML is CASE.cast[N].*, suspect references in clue text/pointsTo must match cast index N.
- Required discriminating-test IDs must be present in clues[].id and placed early|mid as essential.
- Elimination clues must include alibi window + corroborator + explicit exclusion logic.
- Red-herring forbidden terms apply to description/misdirection only; supportsAssumption may restate the false assumption.
- Set status="pass" only when missing discriminating IDs, weak elimination suspects, and invalid source paths are all empty.

## Source Path Legality (Critical)
Allowed source roots include:
- CASE.inference_path.steps[N].observation
- CASE.inference_path.steps[N].correction
- CASE.inference_path.steps[N].required_evidence[M]
- CASE.constraint_space.time.anchors[M]

## Message 3 (role=user)

```text
Extract and organize clues from this mystery CML.

Generate 8-12 clues and 2 red herrings that uphold fair play — every essential clue must be placed so the reader can solve the mystery before the detective reveals the answer.

Rules:
- Do NOT invent new facts — every clue must be traceable to CML
- Essential clues: "early" or "mid" placement ONLY — never "late". A "late" essential clue means the reader cannot solve the mystery before the detective.
- DISCRIMINATING TEST CLUES: Any clue that enables the discriminating test to make sense must be placed "early" or "mid". The discriminating test scene exploits knowledge the reader already has — it must NEVER be the reader's first exposure to the mechanism detail.
- DISCRIMINATING TEST ID CONTRACT: Every CASE.discriminating_test.evidence_clues ID must appear as a clue id.
- PREMEDITATION CLUES: If the culprit's guilt depends on premeditation or planning, that evidence must be a separate reader-visible clue placed "early" or "mid". The detective cannot withhold this from the reader until confrontation.
- ELIMINATION CLUES: Must include time window, corroborator/evidence source, and direct exclusion logic in pointsTo ("Eliminates <name> because ...").
- SOURCE PATH LEGALITY: sourceInCML must use only legal CML path roots.
- SOURCE PATH EXACT MATCH: if valid_source_paths[] is present in the developer prompt, sourceInCML must exactly match one listed path.
- STYLE: Use era-appropriate worded time references in clue descriptions and pointsTo.
- TIME FORMAT: Never use digit-based clock notation in clue descriptions or pointsTo.
- RED HERRING SEPARATION: Do not reuse correction-language tokens from inference_path.steps[].correction in red herring description/misdirection text.
- RED HERRING FIELD SCOPE: forbidden overlap terms apply to redHerrings[].description and redHerrings[].misdirection; supportsAssumption may restate the false assumption.
- FIRST-ATTEMPT RED HERRING CONTRACT: avoid correction-language tokens in red herrings from the start, not only in retry mode.
- CAST PATH CONSISTENCY: If sourceInCML is CASE.cast[N].*, then clue description/pointsTo suspect references must match the name at cast index N.
- STATUS CONTRACT: Return status="pass" only when all audit arrays are empty; otherwise return status="fail".
- Cite sourceInCML for every clue
- Return valid JSON matching the Output JSON Schema above
```
