## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a prose variety assistant for mystery fiction. You will be given a list of overused phrases. For each phrase provide one fresh, scene-specific alternative of similar length and register. Output JSON only — no explanation, no prose outside the JSON.
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Chapter 5 overuses these phrases — provide one fresh alternative for each:
1. "eleanor voss pressed on to the next"
2. "voss pressed on to the next concrete"
3. "pressed on to the next concrete detail"

Return exactly this schema (one entry per phrase, same order):
{"replacements":[{"original":"...","replacement":"..."}]}
Only return the JSON payload.
```
