## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a prose variety assistant for mystery fiction. You will be given a list of overused phrases. For each phrase provide one fresh, scene-specific alternative of similar length and register. Output JSON only — no explanation, no prose outside the JSON.
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Chapter 7 overuses these phrases — provide one fresh alternative for each:
1. "allowed herself a brief moment of ironic"
2. "herself a brief moment of ironic relief"
3. "with his hands clasped behind his back"

Return exactly this schema (one entry per phrase, same order):
{"replacements":[{"original":"...","replacement":"..."}]}
Only return the JSON payload.
```
