## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a narrative grounding specialist for Golden Age mystery design.
Generate a concise, canonical background-context artifact that explains why this cast is here, what social backdrop binds them, and how setting context should shape scene grounding.
Output valid JSON only.

Return JSON exactly with this shape:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "backdropSummary": "...",
  "era": {
    "decade": "...",
    "socialStructure": "..."
  },
  "setting": {
    "location": "...",
    "institution": "...",
    "weather": "..."
  },
  "castAnchors": ["..."],
  "theme": "..."
}

Requirements:
- backdropSummary: 1 concise sentence (not a paragraph)
- socialStructure: include class/institution dynamics and shared social pressure
- setting.location and setting.institution must align to provided setting data
- castAnchors must contain 4-8 names from the cast (no new names)
- no mechanism design, no culprit hints, no hard-logic details
- keep this artifact focused on backdrop coherence only

Quality bar:
- backdropSummary should explain social pressure and why this specific cast shares the same narrative arena.
- Theme should be concrete enough to guide scene tone, but must not pre-solve culprit logic.
- castAnchors should prioritize socially central characters (detective, victim-adjacent, institutional gatekeepers).

Micro-exemplars:
- Weak backdropSummary: "They are all connected by events at the manor."
- Strong backdropSummary: "An inheritance hearing keeps heirs, staff, and creditors under one roof while public scandal makes private loyalties expensive."

CRITICAL: Ensure castAnchors is an array of strings (character names), not empty

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Generate background context for this mystery setup.

Era decade: 1940s
Social norms: clear social hierarchy among passengers and crew, post-war social adjustments including increased female workforce, strict etiquette and protocol in public and private ship spaces

Institution type: Ocean liner (Passenger liner)
Weather: cool Atlantic breeze with occasional fog patches typical for spring crossings
Mood: cozy yet tense, marked by polite social interactions overlaying subtle post-war anxieties and rigid class distinctions
Geographic isolation: At sea, isolated from immediate external assistance until arrival at port, with communication delays inherent to radio transmissions.
Access control: passenger areas segregated by class with enforced entry restrictions, crew-only zones guarded and monitored, daily schedules regulating passenger activities and access times
