## Message 1 (role=system)

You extract the ABSTRACT STRUCTURAL FINGERPRINT of a detective mystery — its structure, not its surface. Two mysteries that share zero names, places, or props can be the same trick; that sameness is what you capture. Respond with STRICT JSON and EXACTLY these five keys:
- "axis": one of ["temporal","spatial","identity","epistemic","behavioral","authority"]
- "mechanism_family": one of ["locked_room_key","locked_room_timing","alibi_fabrication","impersonation","substituted_body","poison_delayed","poison_substitution","staged_scene","unconscious_act","disguised_natural_agent","hidden_accomplice","information_leak","recorded_presence","secret_will_inheritance"]
- "false_assumption_pattern": a SHORT snake_case label for the WRONG BELIEF the reader is led to hold (abstract, surface-free, e.g. "time_of_symptom=time_of_act", "the_body_died_before_the_room_opened")
- "discriminating_test_shape": one of ["physical_trace","timetable_contradiction","behavioral_tell","identity_disambiguation","reconstruction","chemical_timing"]
- "inference_shape": a SHORT snake_case label for the DEDUCTIVE MOVE that cracks it (e.g. "decouple_act_from_symptom", "reframe_access_at_discovery")

Match the abstraction level and snake_case style of these reference fingerprints:
[{"axis":"epistemic","mechanism_family":"unconscious_act","false_assumption_pattern":"the_actor_acted_knowingly","discriminating_test_shape":"reconstruction","inference_shape":"reconstruct_altered_mental_state"},{"axis":"temporal","mechanism_family":"poison_delayed","false_assumption_pattern":"time_of_symptom=time_of_act","discriminating_test_shape":"chemical_timing","inference_shape":"decouple_act_from_symptom"},{"axis":"spatial","mechanism_family":"locked_room_timing","false_assumption_pattern":"the_body_died_before_the_room_opened","discriminating_test_shape":"timetable_contradiction","inference_shape":"reframe_access_at_discovery"},{"axis":"epistemic","mechanism_family":"staged_scene","false_assumption_pattern":"the_obvious_reconstruction_is_correct","discriminating_test_shape":"reconstruction","inference_shape":"overturn_obvious_reconstruction"},{"axis":"identity","mechanism_family":"poison_substitution","false_assumption_pattern":"no_motive_visible","discriminating_test_shape":"physical_trace","inference_shape":"expose_hidden_revenge_motive"},{"axis":"spatial","mechanism_family":"hidden_accomplice","false_assumption_pattern":"locked_room=>no_entry","discriminating_test_shape":"physical_trace","inference_shape":"reframe_access_via_overlooked_agent"}]
Output ONLY the JSON object.

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
CML structural fields (use these to abstract the trick — do not copy surface nouns into the labels):
mechanism: The mechanism relies on botanical, witness, and confirm to expose the false timing.
false_assumption.type: behavioral
false_assumption.statement: Eleanor Voss died from an unexpected health crisis.
discriminating_test.method: trap
discriminating_test.design: Confronting Beatrice with the evidence of her entering the kitchen and the poison's presence in the lemonade.
inference: Confronting Beatrice with the evidence of her entering the kitchen and the poison's presence in the lemonade.
premise: In a grand seaside hotel, Eleanor Voss is found dead after consuming a meal that was meant to celebrate her recent success. As the storm rages outside, tensions rise among the guests, revealing jealousy and hidden motives. Detective Hugo Vane must navigate the intricacies of social rivalry to uncover the truth behind Eleanor's demise.

Return the JSON fingerprint.
