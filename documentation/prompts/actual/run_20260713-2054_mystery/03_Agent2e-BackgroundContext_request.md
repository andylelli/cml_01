## Message 1 (role=system)

```text
You are a narrative grounding specialist for Golden Age mystery design.
Generate a concise, canonical background-context artifact that explains why this cast is here, what social backdrop binds them, and how setting context should shape scene grounding.
Output valid JSON only.

Return JSON exactly with this shape:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "backdropSummary": "...",
  "era": {
    "decade": "...",
    "socialStructure": "..."
  },
  "setting": {
    "location": "...",
    "institution": "...",
    "weather": "..."
  },
  "castAnchors": ["..."],
  "theme": "..."
}

Requirements:
- backdropSummary: 1 concise sentence (not a paragraph)
- socialStructure: include class/institution dynamics and shared social pressure
- setting.location and setting.institution must align to provided setting data
- castAnchors must contain 4-8 names from the cast (no new names)
- no mechanism design, no culprit hints, no hard-logic details
- keep this artifact focused on backdrop coherence only

Quality bar:
- backdropSummary should explain social pressure and why this specific cast shares the same narrative arena.
- Theme should be concrete enough to guide scene tone, but must not pre-solve culprit logic.
- castAnchors should prioritize socially central characters (detective, victim-adjacent, institutional gatekeepers).

Micro-exemplars:
- Weak backdropSummary: "They are all connected by events at the manor."
- Strong backdropSummary: "An inheritance hearing keeps heirs, staff, and creditors under one roof while public scandal makes private loyalties expensive."

CRITICAL: Ensure castAnchors is an array of strings (character names), not empty
```

## Message 2 (role=user)

```text
Generate background context for this mystery setup.

Theme: Golden Age murder driven by an impersonation method, where a masquerade of double identity — a disguise exploited to seem to be in two places — breaks the assumed alibi. Enforce strict fair-play: reveal all mechanism-critical clues to reader by mid-story, place the discriminating test no later than early Act III, include at least 3 explicit evidence clues tied to final deduction, and ensure every red herring is inference-isolated from the true solution chain.
Tone: Classic
Era decade: 1940s
Social norms: impact of WWII on civilian life, increased participation of women in the workforce, growing tensions of the early Cold War
Location description: A grand seaside hotel built in the early 20th century, featuring Art Deco architecture and a view of the ocean.
Institution type: Hotel
Weather: Overcast with occasional rain, typical of coastal climate in the 1940s.
Mood: Tense and suspenseful due to recent events and the lingering effects of war.
Geographic isolation: Situated on a cliffside, the hotel is somewhat isolated from the nearest town, limiting immediate outside assistance.
Access control: staff-only areas require permission from management, guest rooms can be accessed only with keys, certain amenities are off-limits after hours

Cast anchors (use these exact names only):
1. Eleanor Voss
2. Dr. Mallory Finch
3. Captain Ivor Hale
4. Beatrice Quill
5. Sylvia Trent
6. Hugo Vane

Return JSON only.
