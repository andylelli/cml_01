export const AXIS_TYPE_DESCRIPTIONS = `Primary Axis Types:

**temporal**: Mystery depends on when events occurred
- False assumption about timing, sequence, or duration
- Example: Clock stopped at wrong time, events happened in different order
- Discriminating test often involves timeline reconstruction

**spatial**: Mystery depends on where events occurred or who was where
- False assumption about locations, movement, or access
- Example: Room switch, hidden passage, impossible to be in two places
- Discriminating test often involves physical reconstruction

**identity**: Mystery depends on who someone really is
- False assumption about person's identity, role, or relationships
- Example: Impersonation, twin, identity swap, unknown relationship
- Discriminating test often involves knowledge trap or forced revelation

**behavioral**: Mystery depends on character psychology or social patterns
- False assumption about motives, habits, or social expectations
- Example: Unexpected behavior deviation, habit exploitation, motive mismatch
- Discriminating test often involves behavioral inconsistency proof

**authority**: Mystery depends on institutional rules or power structures
- False assumption about permissions, knowledge, or capability
- Example: False credentials, misunderstood hierarchy, rule exploitation
- Discriminating test often involves authority verification or forced choice`;
