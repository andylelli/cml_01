# CML 2.0 — Crime Modeling Language

CML 2.0 is a formal, fair-play specification for modeling mystery logic.

It encodes **why a crime is misunderstood**, not how it is narrated.

## What CML Is For
- Designing fair-play detective fiction
- Validating mystery plots
- Generating solvable cases with AI
- Separating logic from prose

## What CML Is Not
- A plot outline
- A character sheet
- A trope list
- A story generator

## Core Idea
Every mystery fails because of **one mistaken belief**.

CML makes that belief explicit.

## Pipeline (Mandatory Order)

Spec → CML → Validate → Clues → Outline → Prose

Never reverse this order.

## Design Guarantees
- One primary deception axis
- No hidden evidence
- No confessions
- Reader-solvable logic

## Who This Is For
- Mystery writers who care about fairness
- Game designers building deduction systems
- AI researchers generating reasoning puzzles
- Editors and validators checking logic integrity

## Status
Proposed canonical specification.
