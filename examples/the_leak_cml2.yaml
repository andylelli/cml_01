  location: "United States Government Department, Washington, D.C."
  time_frame: "Contemporary to publication (early 20th century)"
  victim: "United States Government (confidential departmental information)"
  harm: "Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive government information affecting markets"

culprit:
  name: "Clerk in the department (exact name Unknown)"
  role: "Government employee with access to confidential documents"

  method: "Secretly transmitting advance government information to outside speculators"

solution:
  summary: >
    The Thinking Machine deduces that the leak could not have come from high-ranking officials,
    as assumed, but from a lower-level clerk who handled document preparation. By analyzing
    physical access, document handling procedures, and the precise timing of market movements,
    he demonstrates that the clerk had both opportunity and motive. The culprit is exposed
    when confronted with the logical impossibility of the leak originating elsewhere.

  false_assumption: >
    The leak must have come from a high-ranking official present at confidential meetings.

  actual_mechanism: >
    A lower-level clerk with routine access to draft documents obtained advance information
    before official release and passed it to speculators, enabling market manipulation.

  discriminating_test: >
    Analysis of the exact timing between document preparation, internal circulation, and
    market fluctuations shows that the leak occurred before high-level review, limiting
    possible sources to clerical staff who handled drafts.

  inference_path:
    - step: 1
      observation: "Market movements occurred immediately after certain documents were drafted but before official release."
      correction: "The leak must have occurred during document preparation, not after high-level meetings."
      effect: "Narrows suspect pool to individuals with early document access."

    - step: 2
      observation: "High-ranking officials had limited physical handling of draft documents."
      correction: "Assuming senior officials leaked the information ignores actual document workflow."
      effect: "Focus shifts to clerical staff who physically handled drafts."

    - step: 3
      observation: "One clerk had both consistent access to drafts and unexplained financial activity."
      correction: "Opportunity and motive coincide in the same individual."
      effect: "Identifies the clerk as the logical source of the leak."

    - step: 4
      observation: "No other staff member had comparable access during the critical time window."
      correction: "Eliminates alternative suspects based on time and access constraints."
      effect: "Confirms the clerk as the sole viable culprit."
