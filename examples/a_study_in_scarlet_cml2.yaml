  meta:
    title: "A Study in Scarlet"
    author: "Arthur Conan Doyle"
    license: "public_domain"
    era:
      decade: "1880s"
      realism_constraints:
        - "Limited forensic methods; heavy reliance on observation and inference"
        - "Slow long-distance communication"
        - "Identity verification relies on records and testimony"
    setting:
      location: "London and associated locales"
      institution: "Metropolitan policing / private inquiry"
    crime_class:
      category: murder
      subtype: "long-horizon revenge"

  surface_model:
    narrative:
      summary: "A man is found murdered with puzzling traces; investigators search for a local motive and immediate personal disputes."
    accepted_facts:
      - "No clear robbery motive in the immediate scene"
      - "Victim’s current circle offers no obvious recent trigger"
      - "Investigators focus on local suspects and recent conflicts"
    inferred_conclusions:
      - "The motive must be local and recent"
      - "If no one nearby has motive, the crime is anomalous or random"

  hidden_model:
    mechanism:
      description: "The murder is driven by long-delayed personal revenge tied to events far outside the victim’s current context; the motive is temporally distant."
      delivery_path:
        - step: "Culprit identifies victim via past identity connection"
        - step: "Culprit engineers proximity/opportunity in the present"
        - step: "Culprit executes murder with staging elements that misdirect toward local interpretations"
    outcome:
      result: "Investigators waste effort on local motive sets while the true causal story lies in the victim’s earlier life."

  false_assumption:
    statement: "A murder’s motive must be discoverable in the victim’s immediate recent life and local relationships."
    type: temporal
    why_it_seems_reasonable: "Most crimes arise from current conflicts; police procedure prioritizes recent associates."
    what_it_hides: "A motive can be latent for years and activated when identity is rediscovered."

  constraint_space:
    time:
      anchors:
        - "Last known ordinary day for victim"
        - "Discovery of body"
      windows:
        - "Short window of opportunity for the act"
        - "Long historical window for motive formation"
      contradictions:
        - "No recent local conflict explains the risk and specificity of the act"

    access:
      actors:
        - "Those who can identify the victim beyond current social circle"
        - "Those with mobility to reach the scene without being part of local network"
      objects:
        - "Letters/records/names that connect past-to-present identity"
      permissions:
        - "An outsider can act if they have a private identification channel"

    physical:
      laws:
        - "Scene traces can point to presence/opportunity but not motive horizon"
      traces:
        - "Clues suggest purposeful targeting rather than random violence"

    social:
      trust_channels:
        - "Police bias toward recent associates"
      authority_sources:
        - "Local witness testimony about the victim’s present life"

  inference_path:
    steps:
      - observation: "Local motive search yields thin or contradictory explanations."
        correction: "Treat lack of local motive as data, not failure."
        effect: "Investigation expands beyond immediate circle."
      - observation: "The crime shows specificity (target selection) without local trigger."
        correction: "Separate 'opportunity in the present' from 'cause in the past.'"
        effect: "Temporal horizon expands for motive formation."
      - observation: "Identity-link clues exist (names/records/recognition pathways)."
        correction: "Model how a past connection could identify the victim now."
        effect: "A distant revenge actor becomes plausible."
      - observation: "A single historical narrative explains the selection and risk."
        correction: "Prefer the explanation that accounts for targeting with minimal new assumptions."
        effect: "Correct motive class established; culprit search becomes constrained."

  discriminating_test:
    method: constraint_proof
    design: "Demonstrate that any purely local-motive model fails to explain target selection, while a past-identity link uniquely explains the crime’s specificity."
    knowledge_revealed: "Culprit possesses knowledge only obtainable from the victim’s prior life."
    pass_condition: "Only one suspect class has access to the past-identity channel."

  fair_play:
    all_clues_visible: true
    no_special_knowledge_required: true
    no_late_information: true
    reader_can_solve: true
    explanation: "The reader can solve by noticing the mismatch between specificity and lack of local motive, then expanding the motive horizon; the key is the temporal correction."
