    title: "The Valley of Fear"
    author: "Arthur Conan Doyle"
    license: "public_domain"
    era:
      decade: "1910s"
      realism_constraints:
        - "Identification relies on witnesses and physical traits, not DNA"
        - "Record systems exist but are imperfect"
    setting:
      location: "Country house / transatlantic echoes"
      institution: "Private estate and associated adversarial groups"
    crime_class:
      category: murder
      subtype: "identity substitution / faked death"

  surface_model:
    narrative:
      summary: "A man is found murdered in his home; the body is assumed to be the householder, and the case proceeds on that certainty."
    accepted_facts:
      - "A body is discovered in the victim’s home"
      - "Circumstances suggest targeted killing"
      - "Identity is accepted based on context and quick recognition"
    inferred_conclusions:
      - "The victim is definitively dead"
      - "The victim’s agency ends at the time of discovery"

  hidden_model:
    mechanism:
      description: "The intended target fakes death using identity substitution so that a different body is misidentified; the 'dead' party continues to act."
      delivery_path:
        - step: "Substitution candidate is positioned"
        - step: "Misidentification is encouraged by context and haste"
        - step: "Target escapes under cover of assumed death"
    outcome:
      result: "Investigators chase motives and killers under a false identity premise; the true target remains active."

  false_assumption:
    statement: "The identity of a discovered corpse is equivalent to the identity of the person believed to live there."
    type: identity
    why_it_seems_reasonable: "Context, clothing, and expectation drive recognition; formal identification is limited."
    what_it_hides: "Identity can be staged; a corpse can be a substitute."

  constraint_space:
    time:
      anchors:
        - "Last confirmed living sighting of the target"
        - "Discovery of the body"
      windows:
        - "Substitution setup window prior to discovery"
      contradictions:
        - "Subsequent events imply agency inconsistent with the target’s supposed death"

    access:
      actors:
        - "Target with knowledge of threats"
        - "Any party able to introduce a substitute"
      objects:
        - "Clothing, documents, identifying personal items"
      permissions:
        - "Household context can bias identification without rigorous checks"

    physical:
      laws:
        - "Misidentification is plausible without modern biometrics"
      traces:
        - "Inconsistencies in bodily features, possessions, or timelines"

    social:
      trust_channels:
        - "Authority declaration of identity"
        - "Witness recognition under expectation"
      authority_sources:
        - "Police conclusion presented as certainty"

  inference_path:
    steps:
      - observation: "Identity certainty rests on contextual recognition rather than strict proof."
        correction: "Treat identity as a hypothesis requiring constraints."
        effect: "Substitution becomes admissible."
      - observation: "Some facts are inconsistent with the target being dead (actions/communications/strategic effects)."
        correction: "Use post-event agency signals to test the death premise."
        effect: "Corpse identity is destabilized."
      - observation: "A feasible substitution pathway exists within the setup window."
        correction: "Model means to stage identity (body, clothing, documents)."
        effect: "Faked death mechanism explains contradictions."
      - observation: "Only one scenario satisfies both the body evidence and continued-agency evidence."
        correction: "Adopt the model that minimizes contradictions."
        effect: "Faked death confirmed; case reorients to living agent."

  discriminating_test:
    method: constraint_proof
    design: "Present a structured identity audit: features, possessions, timing, and post-event agency signals; show that the official ID cannot satisfy the combined constraints."
    knowledge_revealed: "Only insiders know the substitution preparation details."
    pass_condition: "Official identity claim fails; substitution scenario is the only feasible model."

  fair_play:
    all_clues_visible: true
    no_special_knowledge_required: true
    no_late_information: true
    reader_can_solve: true
    explanation: "The reader can solve by noticing that identity is assumed rather than proven and by tracking continued-agency contradictions that force a substitution hypothesis."
