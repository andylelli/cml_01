    narrative:
      summary: "The victim was murdered by an intruder who stole nothing."
    accepted_facts:
      - The door was unlocked
      - A neighbor saw the victim admit someone
      - No forced entry occurred
    inferred_conclusions:
      - The victim trusted the killer
      - The visitor was known to the victim

  hidden_model:
    mechanism:
      description: "The victim admitted a person falsely believed to be someone else."
      delivery_path:
        - step: "Killer impersonated the victim’s brother"
        - step: "Victim relied on voice and expectation"
    outcome:
      result: "Murder without forced entry"
