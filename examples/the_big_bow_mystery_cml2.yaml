    narrative:
      summary: >
        In foggy early December, Mrs. Drabdump cannot rouse her lodger Arthur Constant, whose bedroom door is locked and bolted.
        She fetches retired detective George Grodman, who forces the door and reveals Constant apparently murdered—his throat cut—
        in a room sealed from within and with no weapon present. Scotland Yard’s Inspector Wimp investigates an “impossible” locked-room
        killing. Public pressure builds, and the evidence chain hardens around fellow lodger Tom Mortlake, who is committed for trial as
        the presumed murderer despite the baffling mechanics.
    accepted_facts:
      - "Arthur Constant is found in his bed with his throat cut."
      - "The bedroom appears inaccessible: door locked/bolted; windows fastened; no weapon in the room."
      - "Mrs. Drabdump and Grodman are the first to enter after forcing the door."
      - "Authorities and public treat the case as a locked-room murder requiring an external killer."
      - "Tom Mortlake becomes the prime suspect via circumstantial evidence and narrative momentum."
    inferred_conclusions:
      - "The killer must have entered and exited without leaving an obvious route."
      - "Mortlake is the only plausible suspect who could have managed the feat (official theory)."
  hidden_model:
    mechanism:
      description: >
        The “locked-room murder” is staged: Grodman ensures Constant will be in a deep drugged sleep, then uses Mrs. Drabdump’s
        expectation of murder to mask the true timing. When he forces the door, Constant is still alive (asleep). In the instant
        Mrs. Drabdump recoils and covers her eyes, Grodman cuts Constant’s throat with a razor, immediately removes the razor and
        the sleeping-draught phial, and then guides the witness’s perception so the room is remembered as a sealed murder scene.
      delivery_path:
        - step: "Night before: Grodman cultivates Constant’s trust and gives him sulfonal as a sleeping-draught."
        - step: "Grodman urges Constant to secure the room tightly (bolt/bar/lock; close windows) to preserve the sealed-room conditions."
        - step: "Morning: Mrs. Drabdump fails to rouse Constant and summons Grodman as nearest authoritative help."
        - step: "Grodman forces the door; at first opening Constant is alive but deeply asleep."
        - step: "In the split-second the shocked witness cannot look, Grodman uses a razor to cut Constant’s throat."
        - step: "Grodman conceals the razor and the emptied drug phial, then controls the post-entry narrative and timings."
    outcome:
      result: "George Grodman is the murderer; Tom Mortlake is falsely accused until Grodman confesses to save him."
  false_assumption:
    statement: "Arthur Constant was already dead when the locked, bolted bedroom door was first forced open."
    type: "timing_error / witness_suggestion"
    why_it_seems_reasonable: >
      Mrs. Drabdump expects catastrophe when knocking fails; the room appears sealed; Grodman’s exclamation and rapid covering
      of the face fix the perception of a corpse discovered, not a killing committed at the threshold.
    what_it_hides: >
      The murder happens after the first entry—by the first entrant—so the locked-room problem is an illusion created by shifting
      the time of death and removing the weapon immediately.
  constraint_space:
    time:
      anchors:
        - "Night of Dec 3: Constant visits Grodman privately before retiring."
        - "Early morning Dec 4: Drabdump attempts wake-up; soon after, Grodman forces entry; discovery follows."
      windows:
        - "Administration of sleeping-draught: late evening Dec 3 (before Constant sleeps)."
        - "Actual killing: the instant the bedroom door is forced and the witness is momentarily unable to observe."
      contradictions:
        - "Medical estimates of time of death are too coarse to disprove a very recent killing at the moment of entry."
        - "Witness certainty about 'finding him murdered' is inference shaped by expectation and shock, not a timed observation."
    access:
      actors:
        - "Only Mrs. Drabdump and George Grodman are present at the first entry to the bedroom."
        - "Inspector Wimp and other officials arrive after the scene narrative is established."
      objects:
        - "A razor (weapon) carried by Grodman and removed immediately."
        - "A sulfonal phial used to induce deep sleep and later pocketed by Grodman."
        - "Locks/bolts/windows used to create the sealed-room appearance."
      permissions:
        - "Grodman gains legitimate access as summoned help and is trusted as a retired detective."
    physical:
      laws:
        - "A deeply sedated sleeper will not respond to knocking and may appear inert."
        - "A razor can inflict a lethal throat wound quickly; immediate removal leaves no weapon at the scene."
      traces:
        - "Absence of the weapon is explained by removal during the first moments after entry."
        - "Sealed-room conditions can be created by having the victim lock/bolt up before sleeping."
    social:
      trust_channels:
        - "Deference to Grodman’s expertise as a famous retired detective."
        - "Reliance on Mrs. Drabdump’s emotionally charged testimony."
      authority_sources:
        - "Scotland Yard and the inquest prioritize a coherent public explanation under pressure."
  inference_path:
    steps:
      - observation: "The room’s ‘impossibility’ depends on the premise that the murder occurred before anyone entered."
        correction: "Treat the time of death as uncertain and consider the earliest moment after entry as a candidate window."
        effect: "Reframes the locked-room puzzle into a timing puzzle: who had the first unobserved second after entry?"
      - observation: "Only Mrs. Drabdump and Grodman are present at first entry; both are treated as witnesses, not suspects."
        correction: "First entrants have maximal opportunity and can also shape what the primary witness believes she saw."
        effect: "Moves suspicion to the scene-controlling rescuer: Grodman."
      - observation: "No weapon is found in the sealed bedroom."
        correction: "A weapon can be removed immediately by the first entrant before others arrive."
        effect: "Explains weapon absence without requiring supernatural entry/exit."
      - observation: "Constant fails to respond to loud knocking despite expecting to rise early."
        correction: "A deep sleeping-draught could create unusually prolonged, unarousable sleep."
        effect: "Introduces a plausible precondition: someone ensured Constant would sleep through the knock."
      - observation: "The sealed-room conditions are unusually ‘perfect’ (locked/bolted/windows fastened), as if arranged to be a puzzle."
        correction: "The killer could have induced the victim to secure the room himself, strengthening the future illusion."
        effect: "Targets someone with influence over Constant and interest in an ‘undetectable’ experiment: Grodman."
      - observation: "The decisive fact is whether Constant was alive when the door first opened."
        correction: "If alive then, the killer must be one of the two people at the threshold—and the act can occur in a blink when the witness recoils."
        effect: "Uniquely identifies Grodman as capable (weapon, composure, narrative control) and explains the entire ‘impossible’ structure."
      - observation: "Grodman possesses detailed knowledge of a private late-night visit and the administration of sulfonal, which the case record lacks."
        correction: "Such knowledge implies direct involvement in creating the sleep condition and controlling disclosures."
        effect: "Forces resolution: Grodman can either explain innocently (with corroboration) or is the architect of the crime—leading to confession."
  discriminating_test:
    method: "trap"
    design: >
      A closed-door confrontation is arranged at the highest level (to prevent public panic) in which Grodman is forced to account for
      (1) Constant’s unexplained deep sleep, (2) the missing weapon, and (3) the exact timing at first entry—points that converge only if
      Constant was alive when the door opened. The “trap” is that an innocent witness cannot supply the internal details (drug, private visit,
      razor removal, moment-of-entry cut) without revealing prior undisclosed knowledge and planning.
    knowledge_revealed: >
      Only the murderer can truthfully explain how the sealed-room conditions were created by the victim himself, why the victim did not wake,
      and why no weapon was found—by admitting the drugging, the timing shift, and the immediate concealment of the razor and phial.
    pass_condition: "Grodman provides specific, verifiable details of the drugging and the instant-of-entry killing (amounting to a confession)."
  fair_play:
    all_clues_visible: true
    no_special_knowledge_required: true
    no_late_information: true
    reader_can_solve: true
    explanation: >
      The narrative supplies the key constraints (sealed room, missing weapon, first entry limited to Drabdump and Grodman) and the pivotal pivot
      that witness expectation can masquerade as observation. The possibility of drugged sleep is foreshadowed by Constant’s failure to wake.
      Once the reader questions the assumed time of death, the solution “first entrant kills after entry, removes weapon” follows by ordinary logic.
