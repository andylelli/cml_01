    narrative:
      summary: "A man is murdered; witnesses give sincere but conflicting accounts."

      - "Witnesses are honest"
      - "Alibis appear to conflict"

      - "Testimony cannot be reconciled"

      description: "Spatial perspective and timing errors create an impossible reconstruction."

    statement: "Sincere eyewitness testimony produces an accurate timeline."

    steps:
      - observation: "Accounts overlap impossibly."
        correction: "Spatial positions must be mapped, not narrated."
        effect: "Accepted timeline collapses."
