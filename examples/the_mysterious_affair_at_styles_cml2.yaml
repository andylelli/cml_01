    title: "The Mysterious Affair at Styles"
    author: "Agatha Christie"
    license: "public_domain"
    era:
      decade: "1910s"
      realism_constraints:
        - "Medical evidence is limited but sufficient for timing constraints"
        - "Household routines shape access"
        - "Legal/estate pressure is a primary leverage"
    setting:
      location: "Country manor"
      institution: "Household estate under inheritance pressure"
    crime_class:
      category: murder
      subtype: "delayed-effect poisoning"

  surface_model:
    narrative:
      summary: "A wealthy matriarch dies at night from strychnine; the household assumes poisoning occurred shortly before death within a narrow window."
    accepted_facts:
      - "Death occurs at night with convulsions consistent with strychnine"
      - "Household members assert a tight timeline based on last sightings and sounds"
      - "Focus is placed on who could access the victim near death"
    inferred_conclusions:
      - "Poison was administered close to the time of death"
      - "Alibis for the late-night window are decisive"

  hidden_model:
    mechanism:
      description: "Poison is administered earlier via a trusted medication routine; onset is delayed or mis-timed relative to witnesses’ certainty."
      delivery_path:
        - step: "Access is obtained to the medication/tonic channel earlier"
        - step: "Poison is introduced in a way consistent with routine consumption"
        - step: "Symptoms manifest later, causing observers to anchor poisoning to the time of symptoms"
    outcome:
      result: "Late-night alibis appear to clear the culprit because the causative act occurred earlier."

  false_assumption:
    statement: "The time of death is the same as the time of poisoning."
    type: temporal
    why_it_seems_reasonable: "Symptoms appear suddenly; lay observers equate onset with administration."
    what_it_hides: "A wider earlier window where the causative act occurred through routine channels."

  constraint_space:
    time:
      anchors:
        - "Victim’s routine medication times"
        - "Onset of symptoms and death"
        - "Witness-reported movements during the night"
      windows:
        - "Earlier administration window via medication access"
        - "Nighttime symptom window"
      contradictions:
        - "Assumed administration window conflicts with medical plausibility and access patterns"

    access:
      actors:
        - "Those with control over or proximity to medication preparation/storage"
        - "Those trusted to deliver or handle household health routines"
      objects:
        - "Medication/tonic bottle"
        - "Measuring tools, cups, labels"
      permissions:
        - "Routine handling is normalized and unremarkable"

    physical:
      laws:
        - "Effect can be temporally separated from administration depending on delivery and context"
      traces:
        - "Anomalies in medication handling, preparation timing, or bottle state"

    social:
      trust_channels:
        - "Witness certainty about time-of-poisoning"
        - "Household assumptions about routine safety"
      authority_sources:
        - "Initial doctor/police narrative anchored to symptom timing"

  inference_path:
    steps:
      - observation: "Everyone argues about access near death; certainty is high but based on assumption."
        correction: "Separate symptom onset from administration time."
        effect: "Alibis tied to the late window lose decisiveness."
      - observation: "Medication routine creates earlier access points not treated as suspicious."
        correction: "Treat routine channels as prime delivery paths."
        effect: "Earlier window becomes the true opportunity window."
      - observation: "Only some suspects had unremarked access to medication preparation/storage."
        correction: "Filter by access to the routine channel, not by proximity at death."
        effect: "Suspect set collapses to those with early access."
      - observation: "A beneficiary exists for preserving the false late-night timeline."
        correction: "Use incentive to maintain the mistaken model as behavioral evidence."
        effect: "Culprit is identified through contradictions under pressure."

  discriminating_test:
    method: administrative_pressure
    design: "Apply legal/estate pressure that forces precise accounting of medication handling and timing; observe who contradicts themselves when the administration window is moved earlier."
    knowledge_revealed: "Only the culprit knows the true administration pathway and must defend the false timeline."
    pass_condition: "A suspect produces a contradiction that only arises if they are protecting the earlier administration act."

  fair_play:
    all_clues_visible: true
    no_special_knowledge_required: true
    no_late_information: true
    reader_can_solve: true
    explanation: "The reader can solve by separating symptom onset from administration time and focusing on the routine medication access channel; the key is rejecting time-of-death-as-time-of-poisoning."
