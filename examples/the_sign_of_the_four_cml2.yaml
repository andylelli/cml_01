    title: "The Sign of the Four"
    author: "Arthur Conan Doyle"
    license: "public_domain"
    era:
      decade: "1890s"
      realism_constraints:
        - "Limited communications and surveillance"
        - "Physical pursuit and logistics matter"
        - "Forensics are rudimentary"
    setting:
      location: "London waterways / urban networks"
      institution: "Private inquiry intersecting policing"
    crime_class:
      category: murder
      subtype: "controller-behind-actor"

  surface_model:
    narrative:
      summary: "A murder and treasure pursuit unfold with loud, visible actors; investigators focus on the most conspicuous perpetrator."
    accepted_facts:
      - "A visible actor commits overt actions"
      - "Events seem chaotic and improvisational"
    inferred_conclusions:
      - "The loudest/most visible actor is the principal culprit"
      - "Control and planning are proportional to visibility"

  hidden_model:
    mechanism:
      description: "A concealed controller orchestrates events while a visible agent absorbs attention; agency and control are separated."
      delivery_path:
        - step: "Controller recruits or leverages a visible actor"
        - step: "Controller plans logistics and objectives (treasure, elimination, escape)"
        - step: "Visible actor executes noisy steps, attracting pursuit"
        - step: "Controller remains obscured, benefiting regardless of surface outcomes"
    outcome:
      result: "Investigation misdirected toward the visible actor; true driver remains hidden until benefit/control is analyzed."

  false_assumption:
    statement: "Visibility implies agency: the person seen acting is the person controlling the crime."
    type: identity
    why_it_seems_reasonable: "Humans attribute causality to salient observed actors."
    what_it_hides: "An unseen coordinator can direct outcomes while remaining physically absent."

  constraint_space:
    time:
      anchors:
        - "Initial murder/discovery"
        - "Subsequent movements in pursuit"
      windows:
        - "Intervals where planning must have occurred offstage"
      contradictions:
        - "Apparent improvisation still shows logistics consistency (implying planning)"

    access:
      actors:
        - "Visible actor(s) in the chase"
        - "Possible unseen stakeholder(s) with incentive to remain hidden"
      objects:
        - "Treasure/valuables"
        - "Transport routes (river/streets)"
      permissions:
        - "Controllers can act via intermediaries and correspondence"

    physical:
      laws:
        - "Complex logistics typically require planning"
      traces:
        - "Repeated pattern of movement/targeting suggests coordination"

    social:
      trust_channels:
        - "Police focus on the readily apprehensible suspect"
      authority_sources:
        - "Eyewitness salience ('we saw him do it')"

  inference_path:
    steps:
      - observation: "The visible actor draws attention but behaves as if pursuing a larger plan."
        correction: "Separate execution from orchestration."
        effect: "A controller hypothesis becomes necessary."
      - observation: "Outcomes benefit a party not maximally exposed by the chase."
        correction: "Track benefit consistency, not scene dominance."
        effect: "Hidden stakeholder set is identified."
      - observation: "Logistics imply foreknowledge and coordination."
        correction: "Infer planning nodes that must exist offstage."
        effect: "Controller’s access paths narrow."
      - observation: "A single hidden party benefits across branches of outcomes."
        correction: "Use benefit invariance to identify principal culprit."
        effect: "Controller isolated even if visible actor is captured."

  discriminating_test:
    method: trap
    design: "Introduce a controlled change to the treasure/logistics information and observe who reacts appropriately despite not being in the visible actor loop."
    knowledge_revealed: "Only the controller possesses or seeks updated strategic information."
    pass_condition: "One suspect displays privileged coordination behavior (contact attempts, rerouting, retrieval)."

  fair_play:
    all_clues_visible: true
    no_special_knowledge_required: true
    no_late_information: true
    reader_can_solve: true
    explanation: "The reader can solve by noticing planning-consistent logistics and benefit patterns that exceed the visible actor’s interests; the key is rejecting visibility-as-agency."
