  inference_path:
    steps:
      - observation: "Symptoms appeared later than expected for illness."
        correction: "Poison with delayed onset was used."
        effect: "Timeline narrows to tea service."
      - observation: "Two cups were left on the tray."
        correction: "A swap could occur unnoticed."
        effect: "Access focused on servers."
      - observation: "The culprit’s alibi conflicts with service timing."
        correction: "Alibi was staged."
        effect: "Culprit isolated."
      - observation: "Residue appears only on one cup rim."
        correction: "Only one cup was prepared with poison."
        effect: "Swap hypothesis reinforced."
      - observation: "The kitchen log omits a service entry."
        correction: "Service was handled informally."
        effect: "Opportunity window expands."
      - observation: "A witness recalls a hesitation at pouring."
        correction: "The server recognized the altered cup."
        effect: "Knowledge of the swap narrows suspects."
      - observation: "The culprit avoids the reenactment setup."
        correction: "They fear exposure by the test."
        effect: "Final proof aligns with the trap."
