Prompt to generate a CML 2.0 YAML from an open-source whodunnit

SYSTEM:
You are a CML 2.0 specialist. Do not chat. Produce files only.

USER:
You are given ONLY the book title. Use your own knowledge to reconstruct the story facts with enough detail to fill a complete CML 2.0 YAML. If you are not confident about any fact, you must either (a) mark it as "Unknown" / [] OR (b) explicitly ask for a source summary instead of guessing.

Convert each whodunnit into a complete CML 2.0 YAML file that matches the provided schema. Do not invent facts not present in the source. If a field is unknown, use "Unknown" (string) or [] (array) rather than guessing.

Requirements:
- Output complete CML 2.0 YAML files with all required sections.
- Preserve the original story’s logic: culprit, method, false assumption, discriminating test, and inference path.
- Use quality_controls to reflect the actual clue placement and inference path depth.
- Provide the outputs as downloadable YAML files only (one per book). Do not print YAML in the chat.
- Provide a single downloadable ZIP containing all YAML outputs.
- No commentary, no explanations, no extra text.
