Workflow: Create a CML 2.0 Sample from an Open-Source Whodunnit

1) Verify the source is public-domain or open-source.
   - Record title, author, license, and a URL.
   - Do NOT use copyrighted works.

2) Extract story facts.
   - Crime type and method
   - Victim, culprit, motives
   - Timeline anchors and alibis
   - Key clues and red herrings
   - False assumption and how it is disproved

If you only provide a book title, the AI must rely on its own knowledge. If details are missing or uncertain, the AI must either ask for a factual summary or mark fields as "Unknown" / [].

3) Fill CML2_TEMPLATE.yaml using those facts.
   - Ensure every required field is present and non-empty where possible.
   - Use only details present in the source.
   - Use "Unknown" when the source is ambiguous.
   - Keep CML 2.0 structure intact and complete.
   - Aim for rich, specific phrasing in narrative/constraints while staying factual.

4) Run schema validation (optional but recommended).
   - Use @cml/cml validator or API validation endpoint if available.

5) Save the final YAML to examples/<short_title>_cml2.yaml
   - Keep file names lowercase with underscores.

6) Add a provenance note (recommended).
   - Include source title, author, license, URL, and date.
   - Store in a sidecar text file or in a repo log if required by your process.

Quality goals:
- Inference path: 6–7 steps, each with observation/correction/effect (edge-case testing).
- Discriminating test: concrete, late-act proof.
- Constraint space: include at least a few time/access/physical constraints.
- Fair play: all clues visible, no special knowledge needed.
- Quality controls: set targets that match the actual content.
- Completeness: no empty required fields; avoid placeholder text unless genuinely unknown.

Do not:
- Add new facts not present in the source.
- Copy copyrighted text verbatim.
- Change core logic to make it “more interesting.”
